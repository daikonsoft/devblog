<h1>DaikonScramble</h1>
	<p>DaikonScramble combines the endless wave, single stage gameplay of the classic 1983 Mario Bros arcade game, the movement and fighting mechanics of Super Smash Bros, bunnies, and an ever-expanding elevator shaft. On paper, that's what the game is. In reality, my partner (electronelle) and I (monomori) created it because we were frustrated with our jobs, the state of the world, and the feeling that we weren't doing anything meaningful or creative. So we decided to make something purely because we wanted to—not because anything else was telling us we should.</p>
	<p>But DaikonScramble is more than just an expressive outlet. It's also an experiment in approaching game development with awareness of the emotional and mental challenges that come along the way. This website is where we document that journey.</p>
	<p>You'll find this site functions as part journal, part technical showcase, and part advertisement. Whether you're here to see game mechanics and technical deep-dives, or to hear about the existential dread of porting our game to a different Unity version after Unity completely broke, I hope you find something worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Website Layout</h2>
	<p>Our devblog posts feature two voices: Pearl, who explores the emotional and creative side of development, and the Scientist,
	who tackles the technical challenges. They speak to you and each other in alternating dialogue blocks. Think Japanese RPG dialogue box with an avatar.</p>

	<p>This approach keeps our writing more personal and human, while also allowing us to develop these characters episodically as the story of making DaikonScramble unfolds.</p>
